#Google-Boooks-Search

In this repo, I created a new React-based Google Books Search app. This requires to use React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. This also uses Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
